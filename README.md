# Mini-Vegetable-Dryer-Educational-IoT-Project
This project demonstrates how to build a Mini Vegetable Dryer controlled via a Bluetooth-enabled mobile application. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller, relay module, heating elements, and fans to create a compact, IoT-based drying system for small-scale food dehydration.
# System Components
| Component                  | Description                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ESP32**                  | Main microcontroller for logic and Bluetooth communication |
| **4-Channel Relay Module** | Controls heaters and fans                                  |
| **DHT11/DHT22 Sensor**     | Measures temperature and humidity                          |
| **12V Power Supply**       | Powers heaters and fans                                    |
| **DC-DC Converter**        | Steps down 12V to 5V for ESP32                             |
| **Fans (x2)**              | Provides airflow for drying                                |
| **Heaters (x2)**           | Provides heat for dehydration                              |
| **MIT App Inventor App**   | Mobile interface to monitor and control the system         |

Please go through the files added.
I will add a PID controller in the future.
Thanks!!!
